<h2>Course Overview
</p><p>
<p>ecurity breaches cost companies millions of dollars and destroy customer trust. Learn to identify security vulnerabilities before attackers do. This comprehensive course teaches application security testing for QA professionals.
</p><p>
<h3>Why Security Testing?
</p><p>
<p>*High Demand**: Security testing skills are increasingly required across all QA roles. Companies need QA professionals who can think like attackers.
</p><p>
<p>*Better Compensation**: QA engineers with security skills command 20-40% higher salaries than those without.
</p><p>
<p>*Critical Impact**: Finding a single critical security vulnerability can save a company millions and protect users' sensitive data.
</p><p>
<h3>What Makes This Course Different
</p><p>
<h4>Practical, Hands-On Approach
<li>Test actual vulnerable applications
<li>Use real security testing tools
<li>Practice on realistic scenarios
<li>Build a security testing portfolio
</p><p>
<h4>QA-Focused Content
<p>nlike courses designed for penetration testers, this course is specifically designed for QA professionals:
<li>No deep networking or system administration knowledge required
<li>Focus on application-layer vulnerabilities
<li>Integration with existing QA processes
<li>Practical for everyday testing work
</p><p>
<h4>Industry-Standard Tools
<p>earn the tools used by professional security testers:
<li>OWASP ZAP (free)
<li>Burp Suite Community Edition
<li>Command-line tools for vulnerability scanning
<li>CI/CD security integration tools
</p><p>
<h3>Career Opportunities
