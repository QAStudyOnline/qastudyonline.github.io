<h2>Course Overview
</p><p>
<p>I agents and LLM applications are revolutionizing software, but traditional testing approaches don't work for non-deterministic, autonomous systems. This course teaches you the specialized skills needed to test AI agents effectively.
</p><p>
<h3>Why AI Agent Testing?
</p><p>
<p>s AI agents become more prevalent in production systems, the need for specialized testing expertise is exploding. Companies are struggling to validate AI behaviors, ensure safety, and maintain quality. This course prepares you for this emerging, high-demand field.
</p><p>
<h3>What You'll Build
</p><p>
<li>A complete test suite for an AI customer support agent
<li>Automated prompt injection testing framework
<li>Bias detection and fairness evaluation system
<li>Production monitoring dashboard for AI agents
<li>Multi-agent system integration tests
</p><p>
<h3>The Challenge of Testing AI
</p><p>
<p>raditional testing assumes deterministic behavior - the same input always produces the same output. AI agents break this assumption. You'll learn to:
<li>Handle non-deterministic responses
<li>Define meaningful success criteria
<li>Test for safety and alignment
<li>Monitor agents in production
</p><p>
<h3>Career Opportunities
</p><p>
<p>I testing is one of the fastest-growing specializations in QA:
<li>Average salary: $120,000 - $180,000
<li>High demand, low supply of qualified testers
<li>Work with cutting-edge technology
<li>Shape the future of safe AI deployment
</p><p>
<h3>Who Should Take This Course
</p><p>
<li>QA Engineers looking to specialize in AI testing
<li>Developers building LLM applications
<li>AI/ML Engineers needing testing expertise
<li>Product Managers overseeing AI products
<li>Anyone curious about testing the future of software
</p><p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</p><p>
<p>hile this is an advanced course, you don't need to be an AI expert. We'll teach you what you need to know about AI agents from a testing perspective. Programming experience (especially Python) is helpful but not required.
</p><p>
<h2>What Students Say
</p><p>
<p>"I'm now the go-to person for AI testing at my company. This course gave me skills that literally nobody else has."* - Former Student, now AI QA Lead
