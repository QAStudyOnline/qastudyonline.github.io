## Course Overview

Performance testing is critical for ensuring your applications can handle real-world traffic. In this comprehensive course, you'll learn to use Apache JMeter with Docker, InfluxDB, and Grafana to conduct professional-grade performance testing.

### Why This Course?

Unlike other JMeter courses that teach basic scripting, this course focuses on building a complete, scalable performance testing infrastructure using modern DevOps practices. You'll learn to containerize your tests with Docker, store results in InfluxDB, and create stunning real-time dashboards with Grafana.

### What Makes This Different

- **Production-Ready Setup**: Learn the same setup used by Fortune 500 companies
- **Hands-On Projects**: Test real applications, not just demos
- **Modern Stack**: Docker, InfluxDB, Grafana - tools used in real DevOps environments
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate your performance tests in Jenkins pipelines

### Who Should Take This Course

- QA Engineers wanting to specialize in performance testing
- Developers who need to validate application performance
- DevOps Engineers implementing performance monitoring
- Test Managers planning performance testing strategies

### By the End of This Course

You'll be able to:
- Design and execute comprehensive performance test strategies
